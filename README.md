# My GB songs

copyrat90's GB songs.

See [dmg_audio/](dmg_audio/) directory for the songs.


## Build .gba

This project relies on [Butano engine](https://github.com/GValiente/butano), which is a modern C++ high level engine for the GBA.

To build .gba ROM, you need to install all dependencies of Butano.\
See [Getting Started on Butano](https://gvaliente.github.io/butano/getting_started.html).

After that, you can simply recursive-clone this repo, and run `make`.
